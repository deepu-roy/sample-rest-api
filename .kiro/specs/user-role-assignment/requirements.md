# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables the assignment of roles to users within the system. Users will be able to have roles assigned during user creation, and administrators will be able to modify user roles after creation. This functionality will extend the existing user management system to support role-based access control and permissions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to assign roles to users during user creation, so that new users have appropriate permissions from the start.

#### Acceptance Criteria - User Creation Role Assignment

1. WHEN creating a new user THEN the system SHALL provide a role selection interface
2. WHEN a role is selected during user creation THEN the system SHALL store the role assignment with the user record
3. WHEN no role is explicitly selected THEN the system SHALL assign a default role
4. WHEN the user creation form is submitted with a role THEN the system SHALL validate that the selected role exists
5. IF an invalid role is provided THEN the system SHALL return an error message and prevent user creation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to modify user roles after creation, so that I can adjust permissions as organizational needs change.

#### Acceptance Criteria - Role Modification

1. WHEN viewing a user's details THEN the system SHALL display the current role assignment
2. WHEN an administrator selects a different role for a user THEN the system SHALL update the user's role in the database
3. WHEN a role change is saved THEN the system SHALL confirm the successful update
4. IF the role update fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and maintain the previous role
5. WHEN a user's role is changed THEN the system SHALL log the change for audit purposes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage available roles, so that I can control what roles can be assigned to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria - Role Management

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL have predefined default roles available
2. WHEN displaying role options THEN the system SHALL show all active roles
3. WHEN a role is selected THEN the system SHALL validate the role exists and is active
4. IF a role becomes inactive THEN the system SHALL prevent new assignments but preserve existing assignments

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the role data to be properly structured in the database, so that the system can efficiently query and manage user roles.

#### Acceptance Criteria - Database Structure

1. WHEN a user record is created THEN the system SHALL store the role information in a normalized format
2. WHEN querying users THEN the system SHALL be able to filter users by role
3. WHEN the API returns user data THEN it SHALL include role information in the response
4. WHEN role data is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user interface consumer, I want role information to be available through the API, so that frontend applications can display and manage user roles.

#### Acceptance Criteria - API Integration

1. WHEN fetching user data via API THEN the response SHALL include role information
2. WHEN creating a user via API THEN the system SHALL accept role data in the request payload
3. WHEN updating a user via API THEN the system SHALL allow role modifications
4. WHEN listing users via API THEN the system SHALL support filtering by role
5. IF invalid role data is provided via API THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP error codes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage roles through a dedicated interface, so that I can create, edit, and deactivate roles as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria - Role Management Interface

1. WHEN accessing the role management screen THEN the system SHALL display all existing roles with their details
2. WHEN creating a new role THEN the system SHALL provide a form to enter role name and description
3. WHEN saving a new role THEN the system SHALL validate the role name is unique and not empty
4. WHEN editing an existing role THEN the system SHALL allow modification of name and description
5. WHEN deactivating a role THEN the system SHALL mark it as inactive but preserve existing user assignments
6. IF a role name already exists THEN the system SHALL display an error and prevent creation
7. WHEN a role is successfully created or updated THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message
